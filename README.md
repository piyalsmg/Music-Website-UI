## Music-Website-UI

A simple music website UI using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** consists of a clean layout with a header for navigation (Home, Browse, Playlists), a main section displaying featured songs with images and artist names, and a player section with play/pause, skip, and volume controls. HTML structures the content, CSS styles it with a minimal design and responsive layout, and JavaScript adds interactivity, such as controlling audio playback, updating the progress bar, and enabling skip functionality. The UI is designed to be user-friendly, with modern design elements and smooth transitions.
